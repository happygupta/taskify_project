Firebase CRUD operations:
This app uses Firebase Firestore to store and retrieve task data. Here are the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations that can be performed:

Create: When a user adds a new task, the app creates a new document in Firestore containing the task details.

Read: The app retrieves task data from Firestore and displays it in the task list. When a user clicks on a task, the app reads the details from Firestore and displays them on the task details page.

Delete: When a user deletes a task, the app deletes the corresponding document from Firestore.
